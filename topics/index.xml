During my master&amp;rsquo;s degree I worked on computational electronic structure for multiscale modeling and coupled quantum Monte Carlo to total energy tight binding via the creation of bespoke parameterizations. I also spent a year working in tandem on theoretical and numerical aspects of the tensor eigenpair problem, including conditioning and clustering.</description></item><item><title>Hobbies and Interests</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/hobbies_and_interests/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:29:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/hobbies_and_interests/</guid><description>Hobbies &amp;amp; Interests Observational Astronomy Open these images in a new tab to get them at full size and resolution.
Single shot, unedited image of the Moon through small refractor telescope. Taken in Steinhatchee, FL on 2020/05/22. Single shot, edited image of Jupiter and its four Galilean moons at low magnification. The contrast between the background and moons was enhanced; the glare from Jupiter was reduced and it was recolored to more accurately represent the color seen with the eye that night.</description></item><item><title>Random</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/random/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:05:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/random/</guid><description>Random Prime Number Detector Input a number to determine if it is prime.
The maximum input value before truncation error is 9007199254740991 (~9e15, nine and fifteen zeros!), which is not prime but has a relatively large least factor. This is because JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754, and this number is the largest this format supports.
