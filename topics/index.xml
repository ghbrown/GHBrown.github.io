Single shot, unedited image of the Moon through small refractor telescope. Taken in Steinhatchee, FL on 2020/05/22. Single shot, edited image of Jupiter and its four Galilean moons at low magnification. The contrast between the background and moons was enhanced; the glare from Jupiter was reduced and it was recolored to more accurately represent the color seen with the eye that night.</description></item><item><title>Open Source</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/topics/open_source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/topics/open_source/</guid><description>(Free and) Open Source I believe in free and open source software (FOSS), so I dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to this end.
Here are some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to:
Chapel The Chapel programming language is designed for parallel computing at scale. I package the compiler for Arch Linux, and have contributed multiple routines to built in modules. fortran-lang fortran-lang is a community effort to polish and modernize the Fortran programming language.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/topics/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/topics/publications/</guid><description>Publications 2022 M.

MC: Gucchon, you win or you lose?
Gucchon: I don&amp;rsquo;t care. &amp;ldquo;So we want to make it easy to write parallel programs&amp;hellip;
We can&amp;rsquo;t, writing parallel programs is extremely difficult.&amp;rdquo; - Joe Armstrong &amp;ldquo;7 iterations is a good number.&amp;rdquo; - numerical analysis student
&amp;ldquo;Nothing brings fear to my heart more than a floating point number.</description></item><item><title>Research</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/topics/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/topics/research/</guid><description>Research Research Positions I am fortunate to be advised by Joe Kileel, with whom I am currently working on problems related to low rank tensor approximation. During my master&amp;rsquo;s degree I worked with Edgar Solomonik on theoretical and numerical aspects of the tensor eigenpair problem, and with Harley Johnson on computational electronic structure. As an undergraduate I researched multiple phenomena related to nonequilibrium plasmas including plasma-liquid simulations with David Go and plasma jets with Scott Walton.</description></item></channel></rss>
