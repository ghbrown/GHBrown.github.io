Domino&rsquo;s standard/traditional pizza (top left) has a slightly doughy base with a golden, crisp bottom. At the crust, the dough is crisp on the outside while remaining soft and well inflated on the inside (and covered with a tasty garlic butter).</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/topics/random/deep_dish_chain/>Deep_dish_chain</a></h3><a class=summary href=/topics/random/deep_dish_chain/><p>RANDOM - FOOD REVIEWS DEEP DISH / PAN - CHAIN A review of deep dish and pan style pizzas from national chains (specifically those in the Urbana, IL area) including: Domino&rsquo;s, Jet&rsquo;s, Little Ceasars, Papa John&rsquo;s and Pizza Hut.
Domino&rsquo;s pan pizza (top left) is appropriately doughy with a crisp bottom and a crust that was almost indiscernible from the rest of the pizza. However, the bread/dough was alarmingly sweet as compared to the typical pizza experience.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/topics/research/>Research</a></h3><a class=summary href=/topics/research/><p>RESEARCH RESEARCH POSITIONS As a first year student I plan to investigate research groups with a focus on numerical algorithms, including linear algebra and optimization. During my master&rsquo;s degree I worked on computational electronic structure for multiscale modeling and coupled quantum Monte Carlo to total energy tight binding via the creation of bespoke parameterizations. I also spent a year working in tandem on theoretical and numerical aspects of the tensor eigenpair problem, including conditioning and clustering.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/topics/hobbies_and_interests/>Hobbies and Interests</a></h3><a class=summary href=/topics/hobbies_and_interests/><p>HOBBIES & INTERESTS OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY Open these images in a new tab to get them at full size and resolution.
Single shot, unedited image of the Moon through small refractor telescope. Taken in Steinhatchee, FL on 2020/05/22. Single shot, edited image of Jupiter and its four Galilean moons at low magnification. The contrast between the background and moons was enhanced; the glare from Jupiter was reduced and it was recolored to more accurately represent the color seen with the eye that night.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/topics/random/random/>Random</a></h3><a class=summary href=/topics/random/random/><p>RANDOM PRIME NUMBER DETECTOR Input a number to determine if it is prime.
The maximum input value before truncation error is 9007199254740991 (~9e15, nine and fifteen zeros!), which is not prime but has a relatively large least factor. This is because JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754, and this number is the largest this format supports.
FOOD REVIEWS My goal is to objectively convey the flavors and textures I experience rather than try to generate some rating or ranking you probably wouldn&rsquo;t agree with.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/topics/publications/>Publications</a></h3><a class=summary href=/topics/publications/><p>PUBLICATIONS 2022 M.
