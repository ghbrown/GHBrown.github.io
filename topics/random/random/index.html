which is not prime but has a relatively large least factor.
This is because JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754,
and this number is the largest this format supports.</p><hr><h2 id=food-reviews>FOOD REVIEWS</h2><p>My goal is to objectively convey the flavors and textures I experience rather than try to generate some rating or ranking you probably wouldn&rsquo;t agree with.
I suggest you use these reviews as data points and decide for yourself what sounds good or bad.</p><p><a href=/topics/random/traditional_chain class=mainlink>Hand tossed/traditional pizzas from national chains.</a><br><a href=/topics/random/deep_dish_chain class=mainlink>Deep dish/pan pizzas from national chains.</a></p><hr><h2 id=uncle-gimpys-intellectifier-wallet-reference-sheet>UNCLE GIMPY&rsquo;S INTELLECTIFIER (WALLET REFERENCE SHEET)</h2><p>Here is an old reference sheet with simple formulae for length, area, volume as well as useful conversions.
It&rsquo;s called Uncle Gimpy&rsquo;s Wallet Intellectifier, and is meant to be folded up and kept in a wallet or purse.
This is certainly from a time before internet enabled personal devices (probably at least the 1980s), but these sorts of reference sheets are still just as useful today, if not less common.<br>It is mostly legible in its current state, but I intend to retype and upload a clean copy in the future.<br><br><a href=/media/topics/random/UncleGimpysWalletIntellectifier.pdf class=mainlink target=_blank>Uncle Gimpy&rsquo;s Intellectifier</a></p><hr><h2 id=fun-facts-about-this-website>FUN FACTS ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h2><p>On every refresh of this website the header color is changed according to the selection of a (pseudo)random number.</p><p>I originally wrote this website from scratch in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which was a great learning experience.
Though almost everything is still the same, I&rsquo;ve moved to Hugo for static site generation, which makes maintenance a bit easier.</p><hr></div></div></body></html>
