Domino&amp;rsquo;s standard/traditional pizza (top left) has a slightly doughy base with a golden, crisp bottom. At the crust, the dough is crisp on the outside while remaining soft and well inflated on the inside (and covered with a tasty garlic butter).</description></item><item><title>Deep_dish_chain</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/random/deep_dish_chain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 18:54:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/random/deep_dish_chain/</guid><description>RANDOM - FOOD REVIEWS DEEP DISH / PAN - CHAIN A review of deep dish and pan style pizzas from national chains (specifically those in the Urbana, IL area) including: Domino&amp;rsquo;s, Jet&amp;rsquo;s, Little Ceasars, Papa John&amp;rsquo;s and Pizza Hut.
Domino&amp;rsquo;s pan pizza (top left) is appropriately doughy with a crisp bottom and a crust that was almost indiscernible from the rest of the pizza. However, the bread/dough was alarmingly sweet as compared to the typical pizza experience.</description></item><item><title>Research</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/research/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 12:45:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/research/</guid><description>RESEARCH RESEARCH POSITIONS As a first year student I plan to investigate research groups with a focus on numerical algorithms, including linear algebra and optimization. During my master&amp;rsquo;s degree I worked on computational electronic structure for multiscale modeling and coupled quantum Monte Carlo to total energy tight binding via the creation of bespoke parameterizations. I also spent a year working in tandem on theoretical and numerical aspects of the tensor eigenpair problem, including conditioning and clustering.</description></item><item><title>Hobbies and Interests</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/hobbies_and_interests/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:29:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/hobbies_and_interests/</guid><description>HOBBIES &amp;amp; INTERESTS OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY Open these images in a new tab to get them at full size and resolution.
Single shot, unedited image of the Moon through small refractor telescope. Taken in Steinhatchee, FL on 2020/05/22. Single shot, edited image of Jupiter and its four Galilean moons at low magnification. The contrast between the background and moons was enhanced; the glare from Jupiter was reduced and it was recolored to more accurately represent the color seen with the eye that night.</description></item><item><title>Random</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/random/random/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:05:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/random/random/</guid><description>RANDOM PRIME NUMBER DETECTOR Input a number to determine if it is prime.
The maximum input value before truncation error is 9007199254740991 (~9e15, nine and fifteen zeros!), which is not prime but has a relatively large least factor. This is because JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754, and this number is the largest this format supports.
FOOD REVIEWS My goal is to objectively convey the flavors and textures I experience rather than try to generate some rating or ranking you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t agree with.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/publications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 23:53:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/topics/publications/</guid><description>PUBLICATIONS 2022 M.
