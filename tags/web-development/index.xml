2022-10: website transitioned to Hugo, a massive boon to maintainability and flexibility
2023-01: bought and used the ghbrown.net domain name
Fun Facts On every refresh of this website the header color is changed according to the selection of a (pseudo)random number.
The site structure was originally inspired by and modeled after Matthew Zahr&amp;#39;s website.</description></item><item><title>Prime number detector</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/posts/prime_detector/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/posts/prime_detector/</guid><description>Prime Number Detector Input a number to determine if it is prime.
The maximum input value before truncation error is 9007199254740991 (~9e15, nine and fifteen zeros!), which is not prime but has a relatively large least factor. This is because JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754, and this number is the largest this format supports.
Notes I used this little project to get my feet wet with Javascript when I was building my website from raw HTML and CSS.</description></item></channel></rss>
