When CG is applied in practice the exact solution is unknown and the error cannot be computed or tracked, so the residual or relative residual is used instead.
However, the kinds of guarantees available for residuals are slightly weaker and more involved than is often presented, due to complications introduced by different norms and arithmetic precisions.</description></item><item><title>Linear Algebra Pronunciation Guide</title><link>https://ghbrown.github.io/posts/linear_algebra_pronunciation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 18:00:23 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.github.io/posts/linear_algebra_pronunciation/</guid><description>Linear Algebra Pronunciation Guide Like all fields of mathematics, linear algebra has many prominent figures whose names are non-trivial to pronounce in English (the lingua franca of science and mathematics).
This is further complicated by numerical linear algebra libraries which have inconsistent and unintuitive pronunciations.
Cholesky pronounced: ko - less - key (somewhat throaty ko, like kho) often mispronounced: chuh - less - key notes: this is somewhat muddled by that fact that Choleskly was paternally Polish and maternally French, and grew up in France, but I side with the Polish pronunciation (see references) Schur pronounced: shore often mispronounced: sherr (rhymes with her) Krylov pronounced: cree - lav, cree - luvf often mispronounced: cry - lawv BLAS pronounced: blawz (rhymes with paws), blaws (rhymes with gloss, perhaps slightly less common) often mispronounced: blass (rhymes with class) LAPACK pronounced: L - A - pack (syllabic rhyme with bell - may - pack) often mispronounced: luh - pack SCALAPACK pronounced: skay - luh - pack (syllabic rhyme with may - uh - pack) often mispronounced: anything else PETSC pronounced: pet - see often mispronounced: anything else References: Cholesky, BLAS and LAPACK, PETSc</description></item></channel></rss>
