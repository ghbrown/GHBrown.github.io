Just like any form of gambling, it&amp;rsquo;s almost certainly a bad idea on average, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure out precisely how bad without a pencil and a bit of scratch paper (which I got the next morning).</description></item><item><title>An alternative method to compute Gauss's sum</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/gauss_sum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/gauss_sum/</guid><description>An alternative method to compute Guass&amp;rsquo;s sum (from 1 to n) Gauss famously (and possibly fictionally) computed the sum between 1 and 100 at a young age. His original logic relies on symmetry and geometrical thought, especially triangles.
In this write up we provide an alternative derivation of the same result, but using a technique more reminiscent of strategies for solving ordinary differential equations.</description></item><item><title>Re() and Im() as complex numbers</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/re_im_as_numbers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/re_im_as_numbers/</guid><description>Re() and Im() as complex numbers A summer day in 2019 reading Complex Variables and Applications by Churchill inspired what I now realize is almost certainly a useless (but perhaps slightly amusing) result. Enjoy.</description></item></channel></rss>
