&lt;hr>
&lt;p>An auto race I recently attended also ran a 50/50 raffle, which is where a single winner receives 50% of the money collected from ticket sales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like any form of gambling, it&amp;rsquo;s almost certainly a bad idea on average, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure out precisely how bad without a pencil and a bit of scratch paper (which I got the next morning).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An alternative method to compute Gauss's sum</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/gauss_sum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/gauss_sum/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="an-alternative-method-to-compute-guasss-sum-from-1-to-n">An alternative method to compute Guass&amp;rsquo;s sum (from 1 to n)&lt;/h1>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Gauss famously (and possibly fictionally) computed the sum between 1 and 100 at a young age.
His original logic relies on symmetry and geometrical thought, especially triangles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>A summer day in 2019 reading &lt;em>Complex Variables and Applications&lt;/em> by Churchill inspired what I now realize is almost certainly a useless (but perhaps slightly amusing) result.
