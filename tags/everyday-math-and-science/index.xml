&lt;hr>
&lt;p>An auto race I recently attended also ran a 50/50 raffle, which is where a single winner receives 50% of the money collected from ticket sales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like any form of gambling, it&amp;rsquo;s almost certainly a bad idea on average, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure out precisely how bad without a pencil and a bit of scratch paper (which I got the next morning).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The theoretical minimum time for competition speed climbing</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/speed_climbing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/speed_climbing/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-theoretical-minimum-time-for-competition-speed-climbing">The theoretical minimum time for competition speed climbing&lt;/h1>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>After watching a short documentary on the state and progress of competition speed climbing, with times going ever lower and quotes like &amp;ldquo;we never though X time was possible, and now were not sure how low times will go&amp;rdquo; I was inspired to provide an answer in the form of a lower bound.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>An old reference sheet with simple formulae for length, area, volume as well as useful conversions.
It&amp;rsquo;s called Uncle Gimpy&amp;rsquo;s Intellectifier, and is meant to be folded up and kept in a wallet or purse.
This is certainly from a time before internet enabled personal devices (probably at least the 1980s), but these sorts of reference sheets are still just as useful today, if not less common.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Calculating the number of atoms in the Sun</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/sun_atoms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2018 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/sun_atoms/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="calculating-the-number-of-atoms-in-the-sun">Calculating the number of atoms in the Sun&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>It is said Freeman Dyson attempted to complete this task at the age of 4 or 5.&lt;/p>
