I am a first year student in the Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics graduate program in the Oden Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.

I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2020 with my bacholor's in Mechanical Engineering, and from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2022 with my master's in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

My primary academic interest is in computational and applied mathematics, especially numerical analysis, linear algebra, and optimization.
I also enjoy all of the the adjacent research fields, including physics based applications like multiscale modeling, computer science, and high performance computing.
