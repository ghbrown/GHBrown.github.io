<!-- this page is also showing up with wrong structure (flex stuff)
     but it should be same as index.html-->

<!--
What's happening is that the page will look like garbage/have flexes
looking weird until the content has a lot of text, which forces it to
assume the desired ratio of menu to content.
Somehow I'd like to enforce the proper ratio even when the body has
no/little text.
