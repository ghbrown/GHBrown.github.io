# things you'll forget:
# - hugo server doesn't watch for CSS changes, so you have to change
#   a tracked file for it to refresh the website
# - it probably doesn't watch for any changes in themes/ actually

# really just want my site to be 1:1 with old site before moving
# over, then I can figure out improvements one at a time

# current issues:
#- don't set page titles to THING IN CAPS
#- but instead set menu entries to {.TITLE | capitalize} or something
#  that way it still appears nicely in browser tab
#- set menu in config.toml (here) so I can control order
