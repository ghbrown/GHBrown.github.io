To do:
- change to a Jekyll or Hugo site
  - Jekyll tutorial: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages

- figure out a more aesthetic way to place the navigation links when
  navbar is at top
- move to like a Python class extraction notation where insted of just
  ABOUT ME at the top it's like ghbrown.themecolor(ABOUT_ME)
  (you might also be able to do away with the top left name element
   then)
- Google still complaining about mobile usability
  - try to see exactly what/where it's problem is (small text,
    elements too close, both?)
  - maybe need to add another breakpoint and raise minimum size of
    text (it does look a bit small)?
- remove spacing above and below name element in top left corner (I
  think I can set the margin property or something?)
- weird alignment issues that is thankfully easy to fix with minor
  width hacking and padding (what's the root cause of the asymmetry?)
- add note in Random that this site was inspired by Matthew Zahr's
  but written from scratch
