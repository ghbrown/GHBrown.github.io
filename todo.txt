Current issues:
- negative spacing in menu looks bad on mobile for phones (too close)
- three periods show up as ellipses on publications (probably Hugo
  cranking markdown syntax out)

To do:
- make publications page use full highlighting on the entire citation
  should be like <a> stuff <span class="themecolor">G. H. Brown</span></a>
- three dots are getting crowded on Publications
- change names to main-color and theme-color in main.css (will also
  need to change variables accesses in main.js)
- put numbers next to tags to indicate number of articles
- figure out a more aesthetic way to place the navigation links when
  navbar is at top
- Google still complaining about mobile usability?
  - try to see exactly what/where it's problem is (small text,
    elements too close, both?)
  - maybe need to add another breakpoint and raise minimum size of
    text (it does look a bit small)?
- weird alignment issues that is thankfully easy to fix with minor
  width hacking and padding (what's the root cause of the asymmetry?)
- add note in Random that this site was inspired by Matthew Zahr's
  but written from scratch

Things you'll forget:
- hugo server may not watch for CSS changes, so you have to change
  a tracked file for it to refresh the website
- it may not watch for any changes in themes/ actually
- putting an <!-- html comment --> at the top of a layout outside
  "main" breaks Hugo
- katex equation: $$  <math here> $$
  katex inline  : \\( <math here> \\)
- katex needs \ to be escaped in equation or inline as \\ (so \\
  becomes \\\\ in matrices, for example)
- apparently the same is true for spaces in math mode \; => \\;
- using glink inline with sentence requires {{< glink >}} while
  single line links use {{% glink %}} (changes injection is
  treated as html or markdown)
- CSS selectors is the right term for "p, a" vs "p a" etc.
