Current issues:
- 

To do:
- put numbers next to tags to indicate number of articles
- see if CSS styling can be simplified to make it a bit more theme
  agnostic and extensible/flexible
- add numerical analysis section
- figure out a more aesthetic way to place the navigation links when
  navbar is at top
- Google still complaining about mobile usability
  - try to see exactly what/where it's problem is (small text,
    elements too close, both?)
  - maybe need to add another breakpoint and raise minimum size of
    text (it does look a bit small)?
- weird alignment issues that is thankfully easy to fix with minor
  width hacking and padding (what's the root cause of the asymmetry?)
- add note in Random that this site was inspired by Matthew Zahr's
  but written from scratch
- move to like a Python class extraction notation where insted of just
  ABOUT ME at the top it's like ghbrown.themecolor(ABOUT_ME)?
  (you might also be able to do away with the top left name element
   then)

Things you'll forget:
- hugo server doesn't watch for CSS changes, so you have to change
  a tracked file for it to refresh the website
- it probably doesn't watch for any changes in themes/ actually
- putting an <!-- html comment --> at the top of a layout outside
  "main" breaks Hugo
