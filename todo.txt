To do:
- everything looks too small on mobile and Google complains
  about it (switch to a new relative sizing framework)
- Do I really need the page headers? Why should the top of the main
  columns say "publications" when I already track it with link color?
- switch "Home" to "About Me"
- add note in Random that this site was inspired by Matthew Zahr's
  but written from scratch
