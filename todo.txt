To do:
- everything looks too small on mobile and Google complains
  about it (overhaul sizing and styling (keyword: responsive web
  design))
- see if Google still complains about mobile visibility after refresh
- add note in Random that this site was inspired by Matthew Zahr's
  but written from scratch

flex branch:
- not sure where ratio of navbar to content is getting set currently,
  but I can't seem to change it
- navbar grows too wide even when text has stopped growing in desktop
  mode
- can't get any padding around the container class, and content is
  spilling off
  - probably do a test page with just a flexbox, border, and
    padding
- name in the top right isn't as clean as it is on main (how can
  I remove the spacing above and below)
