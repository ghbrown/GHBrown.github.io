To do:
- everything looks too small on mobile and Google complains
  about it (overhaul sizing and styling (keyword: responsive web
  design))
- see if Google still complains about mobile visibility after refresh
- add note in Random that this site was inspired by Matthew Zahr's
  but written from scratch
