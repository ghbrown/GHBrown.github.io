# RESEARCH

## RESEARCH POSITIONS

As a first year student I plan to investigate research groups with a focus on numerical algorithms, including linear algebra and optimization.
<br>
During my master's degree I worked on computational electronic
structure for multiscale modeling and coupled quantum Monte
Carlo to total energy tight binding via the creation of
bespoke parameterizations.
<br>
I also spent a year working in tandem on theoretical and
numerical aspects of the tensor eigenpair problem, including
conditioning and clustering.
<br>
As an undergraduate I researched multiple phenomena related to
nonequilibrium plasmas - from dielectric barrier discharges
to plasma jets, and from experimentation and instrumentation
to computation.
I also spent one summer with a (chance) position in a nuclear
physics laboratory, which is how I got into research.
