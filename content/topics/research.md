## Research Positions

I am fortunate to be advised by {{< glink dest=https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jkileel/ text="Joe Kileel" color="y" >}}, with whom I am working on problems related to low rank tensor approximation.
<br>
During my master's degree I worked with
{{< glink dest=https://solomonik.cs.illinois.edu/ text="Edgar Solomonik" color=y >}}
on theoretical and numerical aspects of the tensor eigenpair problem, and with
{{< glink dest=https://matse.illinois.edu/people/profile/htj text="Harley Johnson" color="y" >}}
on computational electronic structure.
<br>
As an undergraduate I researched multiple phenomena related to
nonequilibrium plasmas including plasma-liquid simulations with
{{< glink dest=https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/david-go/ text="David Go" color="y" >}}
and plasma jets with
{{< glink dest=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273977200 text="Scott Walton" color="y" >}}.
I also spent one summer with a (chance) position in a nuclear
physics laboratory, which is how I got into research.

## Personal Research Projects

Write ups of my thoughts and efforts on various problems both inside and outside my research field (and of varying degrees of originality and complexity) can be found among {{< glink dest="/tags" text="my posts" int="y" color="y" >}}.
