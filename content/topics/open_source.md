# (Free and) Open Source

---

I believe in free and open source software (FOSS), so I dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to this end.

Here is the project I'm the most proud of:

### visla
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="30%"><img src="/assets/topics/open_source/gemm_10.png" width="100%"></td>
    <td>
      <p>
        <!-- cannot rely on markdown rendering inside of HTML environment -->
        <a href="https://github.com/ghbrown/visla" target=_blank>visla</a>
        renders stunning visualizations of sparse matrices and graphs with ease.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Here are some projects I've contributed to:

### Chapel

- The [Chapel programming language](https://chapel-lang.org/) is designed for parallel computing at scale.
  I [package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chapel) the compiler for Arch Linux, and have contributed multiple routines to built in modules.


### fortran-lang

- [fortran-lang](https://fortran-lang.org/en/) is a community effort to polish and modernize the Fortran programming language.
  Efforts include a [package manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) and a [standard library](https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/) (to which I've contributed routines for linear algebra).


### EndeavourOS

- I've contributed bug fixes to configurations for the [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/i3) version of the [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) Linux distribution.


### beets

- [beets](https://beets.io/) organizes local music collections, including autotagging and so much more.
  I contributed an interface to match single tracks using Discogs.
