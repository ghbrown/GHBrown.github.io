# (Free and) Open Source

---

I believe in free and open source software (FOSS), so I dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to this end.

Here are some projects I've contributed to:

### Chapel

- The {{< glink dest="https://chapel-lang.org/" text="Chapel programming language" color="y" >}} is designed for parallel computing at scale.
  I {{<glink dest="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chapel" text="package" color="y" >}} the compiler for Arch Linux, and have contributed multiple routines to built in modules.


### fortran-lang

- {{< glink dest="https://fortran-lang.org/en/" text="fortran-lang" color="y" >}} is a community effort to polish and modernize the Fortran programming language.
  Efforts include a {{< glink dest="https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/index.html" text="package manager" color="y" >}} and a {{< glink dest="https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/" text="standard library" color="y" >}} (to which I've contributed routines for linear algebra).


### EndeavourOS

- I've contributed bug fixes to configurations for the {{< glink dest="https://i3wm.org/i3" text="i3 window manager" color="y" >}} version of the {{< glink dest="https://endeavouros.com/" text="EndeavourOS" color="y" >}} Linux distribution.


### xmpl

- I wrote {{< glink dest="https://github.com/ghbrown/xmpl" text="xmpl" color="y" >}} to provide useful and understandable examples for Linux commands, right at your fingertips on the command line. You can also write your own examples for quick reference if you don't like mine.


### beets

- {{< glink dest="https://beets.io/" text="beets" color="y" >}} organizes local music collections, including autotagging and so much more.
  I contributed an interface to match single tracks using Discogs.
