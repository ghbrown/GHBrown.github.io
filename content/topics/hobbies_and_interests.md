        Single shot, edited image of Jupiter and its four Galilean moons at low magnification. The contrast between the background and moons was enhanced; the glare from Jupiter was reduced and it was recolored to more accurately represent the color seen with the eye that night. Taken in Dunedin, FL on 2020/06/18.
