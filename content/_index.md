I am a first year student in the Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics graduate program in the Oden Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.

I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2020 with my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, and from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2022 with my master's in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

My primary academic interest is in computational and applied mathematics, especially numerical analysis, linear algebra, and optimization.
I also enjoy all of the the adjacent research fields, including physics based applications like multiscale modeling, computer science, and high performance computing.

Here are some things I've been thinking (and writing) about lately:

- {{< glink dest="posts/linear_algebra_pronunciation" text="Linear Algebra Pronunciation Guide" int="y" color="y" >}}: a guide to commonly mispronounced names and packages

- {{< glink dest="posts/cg_residual" text="Behavior of the Conjugate Gradient Residual" int="y" color="y" >}}: some notes and a small (possibly new) result about residual trends for CG
