I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics graduate program in the Oden Institute advised by {{< glink dest=https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jkileel/ text="Joe Kileel" color="y" >}}.

My primary focus is on computational and applied mathematics, especially numerical analysis, (multi)linear algebra, and optimization.
I also enjoy the intersections of these topics with high performance computing, theoretical computer science, and multiscale modeling.

I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2020 with my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, and from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2022 with my master's in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

Here are some things I've been thinking (and writing) about lately:

- {{< glink dest="posts/linear_algebra_pronunciation" text="Linear Algebra Pronunciation Guide" int="y" color="y" >}}: a guide to commonly mispronounced names and packages

- {{< glink dest="posts/cg_residual" text="Behavior of the Conjugate Gradient Residual" int="y" color="y" >}}: some notes and a small (possibly new) result about residual trends for CG 

- {{< glink dest="posts/sufficient_nonnegative" text="Non-negative Solutions to Non-negative Linear Systems" int="y" color="y" >}}: a sufficient condition for a non-negative linear system to have a non-negative solution
