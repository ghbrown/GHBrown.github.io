## History

- 2020-04: website started as a pandemic project after learning that GitHub offered free hosting, written in plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript (a great learning experience)

- 2022-10: website transitioned to {{< glink dest="https://gohugo.io/" text="Hugo" color="y" >}}, a massive boon to maintainability and flexibility

- 2023-01: bought and used the ghbrown.net domain name

## Fun Facts

- On every refresh of this website the header color is changed according to the selection of a (pseudo)random number.

- The site structure was originally inspired by and modeled after {{< glink dest="https://mjzahr.github.io/" text="Matthew Zahr's website" color="y" >}}.
Zahr was my lecturer for Finite Element Analysis in senior year of college at the time.

- Very little about the structure and aesthetic has changed since then, though quality of life features and content have been added.
