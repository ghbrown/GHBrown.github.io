## History

- 2020-04: website started as a pandemic project after learning that GitHub offered free hosting, written in plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript (a great learning experience)
- 2022-10: website transitioned to {{< glink dest="https://gohugo.io/" text="Hugo" color="y" >}}, a massive boon to maintainability and flexibility
- 2023-01: bought and used the ghbrown.net domain name
- 2024-01: transitioned to using the [risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto) theme, with a moderate amount of modifications

## Fun Facts
