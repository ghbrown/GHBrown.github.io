# The theoretical minimum time for competition speed climbing

---

After watching a short documentary on the state and progress of competition speed climbing, with times going ever lower and quotes like "we never though X time was possible, and now were not sure how low times will go" I was inspired to provide an answer in the form of a lower bound.

In {{< glink dest="/media/posts/speed_climbing/Theoretical minimum time for competition speed climbing - G. H. Brown.pdf" text="this write up" color="y" >}} simple physics and physiological estimates are used calculate this lower bound.
