# Prometheus and Lasagna

---

After hundreds of thousands of years of the species *homo sapiens*, it's truly amazing to be the first person to achieve, create, or experience something.
Maybe someday I'll create an algorithm or prove a theorem which will change the world.
Perhaps one day I'll steal just a bit of knowledge from the gods, and then give it to the world.
However, Aug. 13, 2024 was not to be such a day for me, at least not as such.

I was mid-move between two apartments in the sweltering summer heat of Austin, TX.
Sitting in my old, almost empty apartment I found myself with a problem and a half.
First, the half problem: I was hungry; thankfully this was easily remedied by leftover lasagna in my old fridge.
Second, the whole problem: I had already moved my silverware.

Thoughts of Prometheus, fire, and primacy swirled through my head as I ate that lasagna with a broken piece of tape measure as a utensil.
For now, I'd just have to settle for experiencing something new on behalf of the human race.
After all, it worked pretty well.

## Endnotes

- An old tape measure of mine had broken, but I kept the pieces of the tape (approximately 1 foot long) for possible art projects. It's a pretty cool material!
- Consider this post the sharing of my experience with the world.
- To avoid "first experiences" of your own, I suggest you move your kitchen, utensils, and the contents of your fridge all at once.
