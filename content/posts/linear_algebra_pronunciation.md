# Linear Algebra Pronunciation Guide

---

Like all fields of mathematics, linear algebra has many prominent figures whose names are non-trivial to pronounce in English (the *lingua franca* of science and mathematics). 

This is further complicated by numerical linear algebra libraries which have inconsistent and unintuitive pronunciations.

### Cholesky

- pronounced: ko - less - key (somewhat throaty ko, like kho)
- often mispronounced: chuh - less - key
- notes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Louis_Cholesky" target="_blank" class="mainlink">this is somewhat muddled by that fact that Choleskly was paternally Polish and maternally French, and grew up in France<a>, but I side with the Polish pronunciation (see references)


### Schur

- pronounced: shore
- often mispronounced: sherr (rhymes with her)


### Krylov

- pronounced: cree - lav, cree - luvf
- often mispronounced: cry - lawv


### BLAS

- pronounced: blawz (rhymes with paws), bloss (rhymes with gloss, perhaps slightly less common)
- often mispronounced: blass (rhymes with class)


### LAPACK

- pronounced: L - A - pack (syllabic rhyme with bell - may - pack)
- often mispronounced: luh - pack


### SCALAPACK

- pronounced: skay - luh - pack (syllabic rhyme with may - uh - pack)
- often mispronounced: *anything else*


### PETSC

- pronounced: pet - see
