# An alternative method to compute Guass's sum (from 1 to n)

---

Gauss famously (and possibly fictionally) computed the sum between 1 and 100 at a young age.
His original logic relies on symmetry and geometrical thought, especially triangles.

In {{< glink dest="/media/posts/gauss_sum/An alternative method to compute Gauss's sum - G. H. Brown.pdf" text="this write up" color="y" >}} we provide an alternative derivation of the same result, but using a technique more reminiscent of strategies for solving ordinary differential equations.
